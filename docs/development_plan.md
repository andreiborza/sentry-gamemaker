# Sentry SDK for GameMaker - Implementation Plan

Based on my research, here's a comprehensive step-by-step plan for creating a native Sentry SDK for GameMaker:

## Overview
GameMaker's most native approach for integrating C++ code is through **Extensions** - these are packaged as `.yymps` files that users can easily drag-and-drop into their projects. Extensions can expose C++ functions to GameMaker Language (GML) and handle platform-specific implementations.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Extension Setup
1. **Create Extension Structure**
   - Set up GameMaker extension directory structure
   - Create platform-specific library files (DLL for Windows, dylib for macOS, .so for Linux)
   - Define extension metadata and function signatures

2. **Build System Integration**
   - Extend existing CMake/Makefile to build platform-specific libraries
   - Link against existing Sentry native C++ SDK
   - Create automated build pipeline for all target platforms

### Phase 2: C++ Wrapper Layer
3. **Create GameMaker-Sentry Bridge**
   - Implement C++ wrapper functions with GameMaker-compatible signatures
   - Handle string conversion between GML and C++ 
   - Manage memory allocation/deallocation safely
   - Add error handling and validation

4. **Core Sentry Functions**
   - `sentry_gm_init(dsn, options)` - Initialize Sentry
   - `sentry_gm_capture_message(level, message)` - Send messages
   - `sentry_gm_capture_exception(message, stacktrace)` - Send exceptions
   - `sentry_gm_set_user(id, username, email)` - Set user context
   - `sentry_gm_set_tag(key, value)` - Set tags
   - `sentry_gm_close()` - Cleanup

### Phase 3: GameMaker Integration
5. **GML Helper Scripts**
   - Create GML wrapper scripts for easier usage
   - Add GameMaker-specific context (game version, platform, etc.)
   - Implement automatic error capturing for common GameMaker errors

6. **Extension Package Creation**
   - Package extension as `.yymps` file
   - Include documentation and setup instructions
   - Create sample integration code

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
7. **Advanced Sentry Features**
   - Performance monitoring integration
   - Breadcrumb tracking for GameMaker events
   - Release management and environment detection
   - Custom context and user data

8. **GameMaker-Specific Features**
   - Automatic capture of GameMaker runtime errors
   - Room/object context in error reports
   - Asset loading error tracking
   - Performance metrics for game loops

### Phase 5: Distribution & Documentation
9. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test with the Space Rocks demo project
   - Validate across different GameMaker versions
   - Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)

10. **Documentation & Examples**
    - Integration guide for developers
    - API reference documentation
    - Best practices for GameMaker + Sentry
    - Sample project demonstrating usage

The end result will be a `.yymps` extension package that GameMaker developers can simply drag into their projects, call a few GML functions to initialize, and immediately start receiving error reports and performance data in their Sentry dashboard.
