# Phase 1: Core Extension Setup - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully created a GameMaker extension that bridges the native Sentry C++ SDK to GameMaker Language (GML).

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Extension Structure ✅
- Created complete GameMaker extension directory structure in `extension/Sentry/`
- Generated `Sentry.yy` extension definition file with proper metadata
- Set up platform-specific directories for future expansion

### 2. Native Library ✅
- Built `libsentry_gm.dylib` - the compiled macOS extension library
- Successfully linked against the existing Sentry native C++ SDK
- Automated library deployment to extension directory via CMake

### 3. Function Mapping ✅
Clean GML API exposed to GameMaker developers:
- `sentry_init(dsn, database_path, release, debug)` - Initialize Sentry with options
- `sentry_capture_message(level, message)` - Send messages with severity levels
- `sentry_close()` - Cleanup and close Sentry

Internal C++ implementation uses `sentry_gm_*` prefix to avoid naming conflicts with native Sentry functions.

### 4. Build System ✅
- Extended CMakeLists.txt to build both sample app and GameMaker extension
- Automated compilation of shared library with proper macOS configuration
- Automatic copying of built library to extension directory
- Proper linking and rpath configuration for macOS dylib dependencies

### 5. Sentry Integration ✅
- Successfully integrated with existing Sentry native C++ SDK in `src/sentry-native/`
- Verified functionality with successful HTTP requests to Sentry servers
- Maintains full compatibility with Sentry's error tracking infrastructure

## Technical Details

### Extension Definition
The `Sentry.yy` file defines:
- **Package ID**: `io.sentry.gamemaker`
- **Target Platform**: macOS (target ID: 2)
- **Library File**: `libsentry_gm.dylib`
- **Function Signatures**: Proper argument types and documentation

### Function Implementation
```cpp
// C++ Implementation (sentry_gm.cpp)
double sentry_gm_init(const char* dsn, const char* database_path, const char* release, double debug);
double sentry_gm_capture_message(double level, const char* message);
double sentry_gm_close();
```

### GML Usage
```gml
// GameMaker developers use clean native API
sentry_init("https://your-dsn@sentry.io/project", ".sentry-native", "my-game@1.0.0", 1);
sentry_capture_message(2, "Warning: Low health detected");
sentry_close();
```

## File Structure
```
extension/Sentry/
├── Sentry.yy                 # Extension definition
├── libsentry_gm.dylib       # Compiled native library
├── AndroidSource/           # Future Android support
├── iOSSource/              # Future iOS support
└── platform_files/        # Future multi-platform libraries
```

## Next Steps
Phase 1 provides a solid foundation. The extension is ready for:
- **Testing**: Integration with the Space Rocks demo project
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced C++ wrapper with more Sentry features
- **Multi-platform**: Extension to Windows and Linux support

## Status: READY FOR TESTING
The GameMaker extension can now be imported into GameMaker Studio projects and used immediately with the three core functions.
